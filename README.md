# Predator-prey models, and Hopf bifurcations

In a dynamical system, one encounters a *Hopf bifurcation* at a certain _critical point_, identified by some value of the parameters, when the system moves from a stability solution to an instability, characterized by the emergence of some periodic solution.

This is a phenomenon occurring in several systems: we will consider a simplified predator-prey model in which $x(t)$ represents the _prey_ population, and $y(t)$ represents the _predator_ population. Both populations depend on time $t$, as they evolve interacting with each other.
